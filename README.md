# odin-recipes
practice HTML knowledge. In this project, going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website wonâ€™t look very pretty.
this project is just to build your HTML chops; will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS
